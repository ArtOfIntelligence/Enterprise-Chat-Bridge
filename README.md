#  Enterprise Chat Bridge

  

ECB is a middleware chat engine with **[Push]** to clients.
It fits between your web server and your we application. 
#### Server
##### Protocols: REST API
Because ECB uses REST API only to communicate with your server, you can easily embed it to your existing solution such as ASP.<span></span>NET, Nodejs, PHP etc.

Alternatively, you can build a tiny backend server to communicate with ECB.* 
#### Client
##### Protocols: REST API and WebSockets
ECB is built to work with browser clients (web). It uses Socket.<span></span>IO, which is built on the top of WebSockets. Yet, Socket.<span></span>IO falls back to http, so it supports all browsers modern and old.  
  

##  How does it work?

  

###  Architecture

  

This is how it fits in your solution:

####  Authentication:

1. Your server generates access token to each client

1. Client receives access token and uses it to connect to ECB (All client's communication henceforth is handled by ECB)

####  Messaging

1. Client 2 sends a message

1. ECB forwards the message to your server (for storage) and returns **ack**

1. ECB sends **ack** to Client 2

1. <ins>ECB **pushes** message to Client 1</ins> 

  

###  Terminology
|Term|Meaning|
|--|--|
|Access Token|A string token generated by your server and sent to your client. The access token is later sent from your client to ECB for authentication.|
|Thread|A thread is a conversation, each collection of messages is linked (or grouped) under a single thread.|
|Message|A message is the smallest building block of your chat solution|



###  Security

ECB itself is sessionless, and does not requrie sessions on your server. Instead, it uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for every connected user and for every thread.

##  Cross-browser

  

Browser support is tested in Saucelabs:
