#  Enterprise Chat Bridge (ECB) - <em>Introduction</em>
- ECB is a middleware chat engine with **Push** to clients 
- ECB is server **agnostic**, meaning that it can be deployed on any server/OS that runs <ins>Node.js</ins>
- ECB is highly **customizable** and can fit any chat scenario you need

It fits between your web server and your web application

## Technologies
###  Your Server
![PROTOCOL](https://img.shields.io/badge/Protocol-REST%20API-blue.svg)

Because ECB uses REST API only to communicate with your server, you can easily embed it to your existing solution such as <ins>ASP.<span></span>NET</ins>, <ins>Node.js</ins>, <ins>PHP</ins> etc.

Alternatively, you can build a tiny backend server (a microservice) to communicate with ECB if you don't want to touch you existing server code or serving a static website.

###  Your Client
![PROTOCOL](https://img.shields.io/badge/Protocol-REST%20API-blue.svg) ![PROTOCOL](https://img.shields.io/badge/Protocol-WebSockets-orange.svg)
ECB is built to work with browser clients (web). It uses Socket.<span></span>IO, which is built atop WebSockets. Yet, Socket.<span></span>IO falls back to http, so it supports all browsers, modern and old.

##  How does it work?
###  Architecture

This is how it fits in your solution:
Your Web Clients <--> **ECB** <--> Your Backend Server

![Simple Architecture](./imgs/simple-arch.svg)
  

####  Authentication

1. Your server generates access token to each client
2. Client receives access token and uses it to connect to ECB (All client's communication henceforth is handled by ECB)


####  Messaging 

1. Client 2 sends a message
2. ECB forwards the message to your server (for storage) and returns **ack**
3. ECB sends **ack** to Client 2
4. <ins>ECB **pushes** message to Client 1</ins>

##  Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access Token | A string token generated by your server and sent to your client. The access token is later sent from your client to ECB for authentication. |
| Thread | A thread is a conversation, each collection of messages is linked (or grouped) under a single thread. |
| Message | A message is the smallest building block of your chat solution |
 

##  Security

ECB itself is sessionless, and does not requrie sessions on your server either. Instead, it uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for every connected user and for every thread.
 

###  Keys
You will generate a new RS256 key pair:
Your server will store the private key to encrypt and verify and decode tokens.
ECB and your client will store the private key and use it to verify and decode token.

##  Integration Libraries

While you can implement your server and client from scratch, it's highly recommended to use our integration libraries; they are faster to integrate, and thoroughly tested.


###  Server  

#### ASP.<span>NET (Nuget Package)
[https://www.nuget.org/packages/EnterpriseChatBridgeClient/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EnterpriseChatBridgeClient/)
`nuget install EnterpriseChatBridgeAdapter`  

#### NODE.JS / Express *with Typescript support* (NPM Package)
[https://www.nuget.org/packages/EnterpriseChatBridgeClient/](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EnterpriseChatBridgeClient/)
`npm install ...............`
 
###  Client
#### JavaScript *with Typescript support* (NPM Package)
[https://www.npmjs.com/package/ecb-client-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ecb-client-js)
`npm install ecb-client-js` 

##  Implementation
Depending on how far you are in building your solution, integrating ECB should take anything between 4 and 16 hours.
  
1. **ECB:** Download, configure and start ECB 
2. **Beckend Server:** Implement your ECB backend server
3. **Web Client:** Embed ECB client in your web application
